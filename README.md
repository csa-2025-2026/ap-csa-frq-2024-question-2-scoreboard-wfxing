## Git Config for Local Git
You only need to do this if you are NOT using Codespaces
```
git config user.name "user"
git config user.email "email"
```

## Compiling and Running Java Programs
To compile a Java file, run the following command in the terminal.  Substitute your actual file name for the `FileName`.
```
javac FileName.java
```

Alternatively, you can compile every Java file using the asterisk (*).  Be careful about doing this for larger projects whose files rely on each other though.
```
javac *.java
```
The star means to compile every file that is a Java file type.

Run your code by running
```
java FileName
```

# Close Reading
## Reading 1
After highlighting and annotating the prompt on your first readthrough, answer the following questions in `Scoreboard.java`.

1. Which team always starts first (active team)?
2. If a play does not fail, then how do you know how many points a team earns for that play?
3. How do you know when a play fails, and you have to switch to the other team?


## Reading 2
After comparing your highlights with the scoring guideline, briefly answer the questions below in `Scoreboard.java`.

1. What data or information do you need to keep track of?  List them and their potential data types.
2. From your answer to question 1, which of the data should be **attributes of the class?**  As in, what should the class **HAVE?**  (Alternatively, you can think about it as, "what information should have class level scope, and survive outside of a method".)
    - Cars **HAVE** a `fuelAmount`
    - Trash cans **HAVE** a `capacity`

**2.** This question involves a scoreboard for a game. The game is played between two teams who alternate turns so that at any given time, one team is active and the other team is inactive. During a turn, a team makes one or more plays. Each play can score one or more points and the team's turn continues, or the play can fail, in which case no points are scored and the team's turn ends.

The `Scoreboard` class, which you will write, is used to keep track of the score in a game. The `Scoreboard` class contains a constructor and two methods.

* The constructor has two parameters. The first parameter is a `String` containing the name of team 1, and the second parameter is a `String` containing the name of team 2. The game always begins with team 1 as the active team.
* The `recordPlay` method has a single nonnegative integer parameter that is equal to the number of points scored on a play or 0 if the play failed. If the play results in one or more points scored, the active team's score is updated and that team remains active. If the value of the parameter is 0, the active team's turn ends and the inactive team becomes the active team. The `recordPlay` method does not return a value.
* The `getScore` method has no parameters. The method returns a `String` containing information about the current state of the game. The returned string begins with the score of team 1, followed by a hyphen (`"-"`), followed by the score of team 2, followed by a hyphen, followed by the name of the team that is currently active.

The following table contains a sample code execution sequence and the corresponding results. The code execution sequence appears in a class other than `Scoreboard`.

| Statement | Value Returned (blank if none) | Explanation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `String info;` | | |
| `Scoreboard game = new Scoreboard ("Red", "Blue");` | | `game` is a new `Scoreboard` for a game played between team 1, whose name is "Red", and team 2, whose name is "Blue". The active team is set to team 1. |
| `info = game.getScore();` | `"0-0-Red"` | |
| `game.recordPlay(1);` | | Team 1 earns 1 point because the game always begins with team 1 as the active team. |
| `info = game.getScore();` | `"1-0-Red"` | |
| `game.recordPlay(0);` | | Team 1's play failed, so team 2 is now active. |
| `info = game.getScore();` | `"1-0-Blue"` | |
| `info = game.getScore();` | `"1-0-Blue"` | The score and state of the game are unchanged since the last call to `getScore`. |
| `game.recordPlay(3);` | | Team 2 earns 3 points. |
| `info = game.getScore();` | `"1-3-Blue"` | |
| `game.recordPlay(1);` | | Team 2 earns 1 point. |
| `game.recordPlay(0);` | | Team 2's play failed, so team 1 is now active. |
| `info = game.getScore();` | `"1-4-Red"` | |
| `game.recordPlay(0);` | | Team 1's play failed, so team 2 is now active. |
| `game.recordPlay(4);` | | Team 2 earns 4 points. |
| `game.recordPlay(0);` | | Team 2's play failed, so team 1 is now active. |
| `info = game.getScore();` | `"1-8-Red"` | |
| `Scoreboard match = new Scoreboard ("Lions", "Tigers");` <br> `info = match.getScore();` | `"0-0-Lions"` | `match` is a new and independent `Scoreboard` object. |
| `info = game.getScore();` | `"1-8-Red"` | |

**Write the complete `Scoreboard` class.** Your implementation must meet all specifications and conform to the examples shown in the preceding table.
